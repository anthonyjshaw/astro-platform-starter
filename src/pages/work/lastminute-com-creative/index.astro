A collection of the various pieces of creative work I did for lastminute.com.

### Total Packages landing page

A landing page designed to promote lastminute.com's curated holiday packages.

This was the first project I undertook as part of a newly-created team aimed at providing a more in-depth approach to product marketing. On this landing page, we wanted to keep the tone breezy and playful overall, using highlighter font for emphasis.

### Loyalty program reminder email A/B test

A mockup of a reminder email we wanted to send to users who signed up to the lastminute.com loyalty programme.

We wanted to do an A/B test to see if users would respond better to different call-to-actions intending for them to look at our holiday deals: Version 1 had "Book now", while Version 2 had "Show deals".
